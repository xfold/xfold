### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate Data Scientist and a Visiting Research Associate living in London with expertise in AI, dedicated to
applying ML to tackle realâ€‘world challenges. My passion lies in developing machine learning systems and recommender systems
that are both fair and safe, as I strive to address negative biases and discriminatory tendencies in large language models. With
over 9 years of experience in the field of Artificial Intelligence, NLP and Machine Learning, I possess a strong proficiency in Python.

Please take a look at my repositories and specially to the [AI jungle](https://xfold.github.io/the-ai-jungle/), A wild and exciting collection of other projects (mostly) in Python related to AI and ML.
